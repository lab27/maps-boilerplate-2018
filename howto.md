## Our techstack - a short introduction
![Techstack](/public/techstack.png "Techstack")

### Contentful
We use [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) as our content management system (CMS). In the CMS you can manage any content that is used in your application, for example images and text, but also coordinates for the map. Having a CMS means we don't have to change the code just to add a new image or change a text.

### Vue.js and Sass
Many modern web application are written in a JavaScript framework like [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). These framework try to make it easier for developers to create user interfaces. Vue.js is similar to React and Angular, but has a reputation of being easy to learn. We also use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) which is an extension of CSS.
 
### Heroku and Node.js
To make your application available to people on the internet, you have to run a web server somewhere. We use [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) which provides a platform to run Node.js. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runs our server-side code. Depending on your project, you may not have a lot of code running on the server, but you need at least some code that delievrs your HTML, CSS and Javascript files to the browsers.

### Dev Server
While you are working on your project, it would be inconvenient if you had to send all your changes to Heroku to see if your code works. For that reason we use a local development server that runs on your machine. 

### Git and Github
Git helps us to work with other people on the same project by providing version control. But even if you work alone, it is good to use version control. It allows you to go back to a working state, if you mess something up. Git can be quite complex to use, but we will start with the basics in this class. It is integrated in the IDE that we will use, so you don't have to use the command line if you don't want to. A project in Git is called a repository.
There are many tutorial for how to use Git, for example [this one](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials).
We store our Git repositories here on [Github](https://github.com/). Github can be connected to Heroku so that whenever you push a change to Github, Heroku deploys your new code.

## Getting started with the project
using VS code?

## Looking at the project in the browser

## Changing the style

## Sharing my changes with the my team
-conflicts? (add a link to merging)

## Getting changes from my team
-conflicts? (add a link to merging)

## Changing the content
when to use CMS, when to edit the source
### Changing text
### Changing text using the CMS
### Adding an image

## Adding a location to the map
link to the other file

## Testing the project on a mobile device
### Device emulation on the desktop
* Emulating the location
### Connecting a real device
